## **Expense Tracker Application**

### **Overview**

The **Expense Tracker** is a **Spring Boot** application designed for managing personal finances. It provides users with a streamlined interface to **add, edit, delete, and search expenses**, alongside visualizing expenses through detailed statistics. Built with robust Java-based backend and a responsive frontend, this application offers intuitive tools to manage day-to-day expenses efficiently.

### **Technologies and Their Usage**

#### **1. Spring Boot (Backend Framework)**
**Spring Boot** powers the backend, providing a flexible, scalable, and easy-to-configure framework for building REST APIs and rendering server-side views using **Thymeleaf**.

- **Why Spring Boot?** Spring Boot’s simplicity allows for rapid application development while incorporating powerful features like dependency injection, security, and persistence.
- **Usage**: The application’s business logic is managed by Spring Boot, handling CRUD operations, routing, and connecting the application to the database through **Spring Data JPA**.
- **Interesting Note**: Spring Boot’s integration with **Thymeleaf** allowed seamless rendering of dynamic pages, providing a responsive and interactive experience for users.

#### **2. Spring Data JPA (Data Management)**
The application uses **Spring Data JPA** to manage the interaction with the database.

- **Usage**: All database operations, such as adding, editing, and deleting expenses, are handled by Spring Data JPA. The framework abstracts away most of the boilerplate code, allowing for easier database manipulation.
- **Outcome**: The integration allows the app to efficiently query the database and fetch data for paginated views and statistical calculations.

#### **3. Thymeleaf (Server-Side Templating)**
**Thymeleaf** is used to generate the dynamic HTML content that powers the application’s UI.

- **Usage**: Thymeleaf renders HTML templates for displaying the **expense list**, **add/edit forms**, and **expense statistics**. It is responsible for delivering user-friendly and interactive pages.
- **Why Thymeleaf?** Its seamless integration with Spring Boot made it an ideal choice for server-side rendering, enabling rapid and flexible UI development.
- **Achievements**: The form-based pages provided an intuitive way for users to add and manage expenses, while the paginated view allows smooth navigation through extensive records.

#### **4. Bootstrap 4.5 (Frontend UI Framework)**
For styling and responsive design, **Bootstrap 4.5** is integrated into the front end.

- **Usage**: Bootstrap ensures that the user interface is responsive, modern, and easy to navigate. It styles the **expense list**, **forms**, and **statistics pages**.
- **Why Bootstrap?** It offers a rich collection of pre-built components that improve development speed while ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- **Achievements**: The Bootstrap-powered UI provides a professional look and feel, allowing users to manage their expenses efficiently on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### **5. H2 Database (In-Memory Database)**
An **H2 Database** is used for data storage and retrieval, allowing for quick access and testing without external database dependencies.

- **Usage**: The in-memory H2 database stores all expense records. It supports CRUD operations and the necessary queries to calculate statistics such as **category-wise** and **monthly breakdowns**.
- **Why H2?** Its lightweight, in-memory nature simplifies testing and reduces setup complexity, making it an ideal choice for development environments.
- **Outcome**: The app’s expense data is stored efficiently in the H2 database and accessed with near-instant performance.
